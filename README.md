# Search-ReusableControl
A simple reusable control to search a bindable rich-text-box.
The current implementation searches by regex, however that could be changed to fit one's needs.
There are currently 2 ways to search, either highlight all the matches(regex) at once or highlight one at a time with consecutive button clicks.
